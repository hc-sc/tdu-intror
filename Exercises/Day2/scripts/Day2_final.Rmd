# This chunk of code contains all the setup required to run this report, including overall document options, loading packages and data, and cleaning data and creating new variables. Since the chunk setting is "include = FALSE", the code will not appear in the final output document.

# 24 Nov 2021: Updated the scripts to include the 'path=' argument in ggsave instead of the full filepath being fed in the 'filepath' argument 

# SETUP: set markdown file global (i.e. overall) options
# this sets options for the whole document: here we have specified 
# not to show/"echo" the code in knitted output, and not to show warning 
# messages in output.

# Summary

This report summarizes information about `r nrow(cases)` of tuberculosis diagnosed between `r min(cases$Diagnosis_month)` and `r max(cases$Diagnosis_month)` that were associated with an outbreak in the communities of X and Y. 
The report follows this structure: [Outbreak Summaries](https://outbreaktools.ca/background/epidemiological-summaries/)

# Outbreak Identification

Insert information about how and when the outbreak was identified, and steps taken to confirm the existence of the outbreak.

# Descriptive Epidemiology
You can write some text here describing your analysis and investigation. You can **format** the text in all *kinds* of ways.

## Epidemic curves

```{r epicurve, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.cap= "TB cases by date of diagnosis"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Exercise_Day2","output", "plot_cases_month.jpeg"))

```


```{r , fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.cap= "TB cases by date of diagnosis and gender"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Exercise_Day2","output", "plot_cases_month_gender.jpeg"))
```


```{r time_infectiousness, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.cap="TB cases by date of diagnosis and infectiousness"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Exercise_Day2","output", "plot_cases_month_infectiousness.jpeg"))
```


```{r iso_epicurve, fig.width=7, fig.height=2, fig.cap="TB cases by week of symptom onset"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Exercise_Day2","output", "plot_cases_epiweek.jpeg"))
```



## Age group and gender of contacts

```{r contact_demogs_counts,  fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.cap= "TB contacts by age group and gender, counts" }
knitr::include_graphics(here("Exercise_Day2","output", "plot_contacts_agegender_count.jpeg"))
```


## Site of TB infection

```{r table_cases_site}

source(here("Exercise_Day2","scripts","03_3_tab_case_site.r"))

tab_case_site_infection # display the table created in the sourced code

```

## Residential location
Cases and contacts lived either on reserve in community X, or off reserve in the larger community Y. 
This is where you would type any description of these results. You can make text **bold** or *italicized* with annotation. 


```{r tab_location, tab.cap = "Residential location of cases and contacts"}

source(here("Exercise_Day2","scripts","05_2_tab_location.r"))

tab_location
```


## Network visualization 

```{r sna_location, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 7, fig.cap= "Network visualization of TB cases and contacts, by location of residence"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Exercise_Day2","output", "plot_sna_location.jpeg"))
```

# Discussion and Conclusions
Insert any interpretations of the data and conclusions. 01.1
